## Motivation 
My very first android project where I had to design the UI and the architecture completely by myself. I figured there was a lot more to it than what meets the eye when a product had to be developed and this gave me a rather in depth understanding of what is involved. As a result , I ended up learning about many design patterns and technologies that I previously did not have an understanding of.
